<h1>EVO | Park Circle (N. Charleston)</h1>
<p>The best pizza in town. Local and regional ingredients. Killer salads. Amazing appetizers.  I like going with a friend and splitting a pizza and a salad or maybe a snack plate. The ingredients change almost daily so you're going to have something a little different every time you eat at EVO. Great beer selection. Can't go wrong! <a href="http://evopizza.com/">http://evopizza.com/</a></p>
